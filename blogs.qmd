Here are the blogs where I share my thoughts and notes on various topics.

## LLM for Theorem Proving

- SeedProver: [@chen2025seedproverdeepbroadreasoning]
  - Lemma-Style Proving: 分解任务, 独立验证, 构建知识库, 组合证明.
  - Test-Time Scaling
    - Light: Proof Sketch → Lean → Error Feedback → Refine
    - Medium: Outer Loop for main theorem, Inner Loop for hard lemmas.
    - Heavy: Conjecture Proposer (Conjecture Pool) → Light Prover → Lemma Pool → Evaluate → Select High-Quality Lemmas, let Medium Prover prove main theorem again.
  - IMO 2025: 4/6 problems solved.

## Formal Methods in AI

**Static Analysis for DL Architectures**:

- DEBAR: [Detecting numerical bugs in neural network architectures](./Blogs/FSE20.qmd) [@FSE20Zhang]
  - Affine Relations Abstract Domain.
  - Tensor Partitioning.
- RANUM: [Reliability Assurance for Deep Neural Network Architectures Against Numerical Defects](./Blogs/ICSE23.qmd) [@ICSE23Li]
  - Potential-Defect Detection via Static Analysis.
  - Feasibility Confirmation via Two-Step Test Generation.
  - Fix Suggestion via Abstract Optimization.


**Static Analysis for DL Models**:

- Use SMT solvers to verify properties of DL models.
- Use integer programming to verify robustness of DL models.
- Abstract interpretation for DL models. (e.g., $\text{AI}^2$, DeepPoly, etc.)
  - Zonotope abstract domain.

SOTA tools:

- $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN

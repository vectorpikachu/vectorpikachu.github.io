Here are the notes of the papers I've read.

## Formal Methods in AI

**Static Analysis for DL Architectures**:

- DEBAR: [Detecting numerical bugs in neural network architectures](./Paper_Notes/FSE20.qmd) [@FSE20Zhang]
  - Affine Relations Abstract Domain.
  - Tensor Partitioning.
- RANUM: [Reliability Assurance for Deep Neural Network Architectures Against Numerical Defects](./Paper_Notes/ICSE23.qmd) [@ICSE23Li]
  - Potential-Defect Detection via Static Analysis.
  - Feasibility Confirmation via Two-Step Test Generation.
  - Fix Suggestion via Abstract Optimization.


**Static Analysis for DL Models**:

- Use SMT solvers to verify properties of DL models.
- Use integer programming to verify robustness of DL models.
- Abstract interpretation for DL models. (e.g., $\text{AI}^2$, DeepPoly, etc.)
  - Zonotope abstract domain.
